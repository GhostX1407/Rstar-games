    <p style="margin-left: 26%;margin-right: 30%; font-size: 20px;color: white;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We have an incredibly vibrant Rockstar Games community. Every day, millions of players across the globe are working their way up the criminal ladder in GTA Online or living the life of an outlaw in Red Dead Online. While these fictional worlds are filled with possibilities, maintaining a foundation of fair play, respect, and player safety for everyone is our highest priority.<br>
        <br>To ensure a positive gaming experience — including a welcoming, fun, and fair environment for our community — we encourage everyone to follow these basic guiding principles and to adhere to our Community Guidelines.<br>
        <br>Additionally, these guidelines outline what behavior and actions we do not allow, as more fully detailed in our Terms of Service, and will be updated periodically to reflect any ongoing changes to the player experience.<br>
        <br>If you observe players not acting in accordance with our Community Guidelines, we strongly encourage you to report this behavior using the in-game reporting tools or through the options available on our website. In addition, we may record and review voice chat, text chat, and other online gameplay data, including by using automated tools, to investigate and enforce violations of our Community Guidelines.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 26%;margin-right: 30%; font-size: 20px;color: white;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We do not tolerate abuse, inappropriate behavior, or threats against our community or team members of Rockstar Games.<br>


        <br>If a player violates our Community Guidelines, we reserve the right to take action against that account. The type of action will depend on the case, the severity, and the frequency of violations we find on the account — if appropriate, these violations will be reported to law enforcement. Players who are found to violate our Community Guidelines may see additional enforcement actions taken against their account, including feature suspensions, and account suspensions and bans.<br>
        
        
        <br>If you need to make a report, please use the in-game reporting tools or the options available on our website.<br>
        
        
        <br>We build our experiences to be enjoyed by as many of our community members as possible. By maintaining a foundation of fair play, player safety and respect, you will provide yourself and others the opportunity to experience these living worlds and grow the community in a fun and friendly environment.<br></p>
